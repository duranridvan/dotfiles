dotfiles
========

My dotfiles for applications I use such as vim, zsh, iTerm2 on OSX and Konsole
on Linux.

To install:

    cd && git clone https://github.com/hassanrom/dotfiles.git && dotfiles/install.sh

On Mac, I use GNU's ls instead of the BSD's ls to get consistent dir colors
as my Linux environment. To install GNU's ls using homebrew:

    brew install coreutils
