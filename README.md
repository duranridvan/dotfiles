dotfiles
========

My dotfiles for applications I use such as vim, zsh, iTerm2.

To install, first grab the files:

    git clone https://github.com/hassanrom/dotfiles.git

To install vim dotfiles:

    ln -s dotfiles/vimrc ~/.vimrc
    ln -s dotfiles/vim ~/.vim

To install zsh dotfiles:

    ln -s dotfiles/zsh ~/.zsh
    ln -s dotfiles/zshrc ~/.zshrc

I use iTerm2 with Solarized theme.
